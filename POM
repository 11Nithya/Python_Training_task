#What is POM why do we need it and what we lose if we use it

Definition-- POM(Page Object Model)is a object design pattern in Python

Where web pages are represented as classes, and the various elements on the page 
are defined as variables of the class. All possible user interactions can then be 
implemented as functions on the class.


A better approach to script maintenance is to create a separate class file which would find 
web elements, fill them or verify them. This class can be reused in all the scripts using that 
element. In future, if there is a change in the web element, we need to make the change in 
just 1 class file and not 10 different scripts.
- This approach is called Page Object Model (POM). 
- It helps make the code more readable, maintainable, and reusable.


disadvantage-

if there is an application with thousands of web pages than the time and the effort in develpoing of automation framework will be high
