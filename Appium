   Native application- Native apps are developed for use on a specific device and can be installed from the App Store such as Google Store.
   They can work offline and can also use the device notification system.
   eg: Calendar, calculator
   
   Web Application:  They are the websites that run on browsers. They are not developed for particular browsers . Since they run on browsers they dont give any installation
